  * Remove part of the cron patch, it was redundant.
  * Workaround to preserve language environment for fortunes closes: #340903,
    thanks to Benoit Dejean <benoit@placenet.org> for the report.
  * Openvpn logs to daemon, the server uses ovpn-[^\s]* as name. (The simpler
    form ovpn-\S* does not work, 'cause logwatch lowercases all conf options.)
    closes: #341863, thanks to David Anselmi <anselmi@anselmi.us> for the
    report.
  * logfiles/daemon.conf didn't contain the calls to the appropriate logfile
    scripts. closes: #343331, thanks to Arne Roolfs <aroolfs@gmx.de> for the
    report.

      Closes: #317913, fixes in pure-ftpd

    some GNUism.

logwatch (6.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop Recommends on libtie-ixhash-perl, libdate-calc-perl. services/exim
    no longer needs them.

logwatch (6.0.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Many patches were applied upstream
  * Remove the Makefile, do that job in debian/rules.

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Sat, 30 Apr 2005 16:02:53 +0200

logwatch (6.0.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #302423)
    - Dropped many patches that were applied upstream.
    - gawk is no longer needed for sendmail-largeboxes
      (changes in README.Debian and control)
    - some patch porting in sshd.
  * fixes from 5.2.2-5 and 5.2.2-6:
    - services/http:
      + Support .html.language-ext html files. (Bug: #303345, thanks to
        Klaus Ethgen <Klaus@Ethgen.de> for the report and the fix)
      + Add support for "/sqwebmail".
    - Accept more chars in usernames in services/sudo script (Bug: #302132,
      thanks to Richard Mortimer <richm@esblimited.co.uk>)
  * Add perl header "#!/usr/bin/perl" at the top of every executeable perl
    script. The code is in the Makefile. Don't know why upstream removed it.

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Mon, 21 Mar 2005 20:39:45 +0100

logwatch (5.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Reformat README.Debian.
  * Add info to README.Debian how to get correct http output when using
    default apache1 configuration as LogFormat. Add the apache1 default
    LogFormat as alternative to conf/services/http.conf. (Closes: #293115,
    thanks to Vic Gedris <debian_bugs@gedris.org>)
  * Make the smartd service (smartmontools) working. It's logging to
    daemon.log, not to messages. (Closes: #295234, thanks to
    Piotr Krukowiecki <piotrwww@krukowiecki.net>)
  * Set LC_ALL=C in the main logwatch script. (closes: #296979, thanks to
    Gilmar Junior <gilmar_santos_jr-geral@yahoo.com.br>
  * Fix logfiles/http.conf. All events were logged twice.
  * Correct logfiles/{daemon,http,maillog,secure}.conf to always include the
    first rotated logfile. (So no need to use --archives for full accuracy for
    reports of range "yesterday"). Otherwise some events might get lost. Some
    other logfile configurations should also get corrected but I can't verify
    them because I don't have the services running.

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Wed, 16 Feb 2005 19:43:30 +0100

  * s/_/./ in conf/logfiles/http.conf to make it work with apache1
  * Syslogd now gets feeded by syslog logfile, not messages.
  * Added a kernel logfile group (kern.log), and the kernel script now
    uses this instead of messages.
   (thanks to Petr Stehlik <pstehlik@sophics.cz> for the last three
    suggested enhancements, closes: #287963)
  * Added short info how to modify a filter to README.Debian

  * Fix for parsing postfix 2.1.4. ("Client Host") (closes: #275051, thanks to
    Wayne Davison <wayned@users.sourceforge.net>)

   Urgency medium because of wrong copyright file currently in sarge.

  * Correct copyright file.
  * Fix the service extraction in pam_unix for woody.
  * exim filter:
    - Fix some problems with the exim service script and the
      logfile config file.
    - include information in Readme.Debian about the required packages
      for the exim script.
    (closes: #260056, thanks to James Clendenan for the report.)
  * Fix reporting of samba in pam_unix.
  * Throw out some unneeded lines in debian/rules.

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Mon, 21 Jun 2004 22:50:52 +0200

logwatch (5.1-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    Urgency medium because non-working cron-reporting should go away from
    testing as fast as possible.

  * Fix cron-script /usr/bin -> /usr/sbin. (closes: #253859, thanks to
    Ian MacDonald). Forgot to list that change in previous changelog.
  * Fix (the first really upstream?) bug in logwatch: A small mistake
    in sshd-reporting. (thanks to Manabu Matsui, closes: #254968)

logwatch (5.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typo in Description, thanks to Gustavo Franco (closes: #247497)
  * Fix pam_unix reporting. It seems that pam has changed. Maybe I need
    script that warns me when the log-format of pam_unix-entries changes...
    thanks for reporting Klaus Ethgen. (closes: #247257)
  * Handle some previously unmatched lines in secure. Added temporary hack
    to have a nice output until I can fix #239626.
  * Add syslog.0 as logfile to syslog.conf because syslog is rotated daily,
    so I would never see cron-reporting if I use logwatch from
    command-line (helps development).
  + Move symlink to main script from /usr/bin -> /usr/sbin. Fixes a lintian
    warning. (This changelog entry was added after the package has been
    uploaded.)

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Wed,  5 May 2004 19:47:35 +0200

    Michael Stovenour for the report (closes: #239626)
  * Added fortune-mod to Suggests.
  * Removed some lines which were already commented out.

 -- Willi Mann <willi@wm1.at>  Mon, 15 Mar 2004 21:31:39 +0100

logwatch (5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Verify in the cron script that logwatch is really installed
    (not removed-but-not-purged)
  * Set standards-version to 3.6.1.0 instead of 3.6.1 to exactly match
    the current version.
  * Make reporting of syslogd - restarts working again

    mail.warn to avoid possible double-reporting
  * Avoid calling the target install of Makefile twice

logwatch (5.0+5.1pre1-2) unstable; urgency=low

logwatch (5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Reporting for many services should work, including cron, ssh, courier,
    exim.
  * Please report bugs. If a particular service has no output, I need the path
    to the logfile(s). That's most likely the problem.
